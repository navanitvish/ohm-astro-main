                The Panchang is a Hindu daily calendar that is based on the
                Vedic Astrology concepts. It presents significant Astrological
                information in the form of a table and is determined by
                thoroughly studying the daily planetary positions. Favorable
                dates or tithis, timings, festivals, Upvas, etc. can be
                determined by reading Panchang or Panchangam.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Panchang is very useful in day-to-day life as it gives a clear
                idea of favorable and unfavorable planetary positions ruling
                different aspects. By referring to the information provided in
                it, an individual can decide whether or not it is a favorable
                time to carry out a particular task.

                  The word Panchang has a Sanskrit origin and it translates to
                  five limbs which are five visible and invisible sources of
                  energy. Majorly, there are five components of Panchang:-

                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                  With the change in date and time, the 5 components of Panchang
                  also change.

                <p>
                  It is believed that when an individual commences their task
                  after carefully studying the favorability and unfavorability
                  of these 5 components, it helps them in the accomplishment of
                  their important tasks and brings fortune, luck, and prosperity
                  to their lives. Thus, it is necessary to keep yourself updated
