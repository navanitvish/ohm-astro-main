      "By using triangular (Trikona) bhavas of the Janam Kundali: 1st House is associated with the Present Birth, 5th house is associated with the Rebirth (Punar Janma) and the last one is the 9th house which is associated with Pre-Birth (Poorva Janma). And, to read all these Astrological combinations, numerous Dasha concepts have been given by famous sages in our classics, like Vimshottari Dasha which is also calculated for 120 years to read one‚Äôs life cycle which is based on Karmas.",
      "Different Systems of Vedic Astrology have Karma as one of their significant factors to determine one‚Äôs fate. It is the Karmas that create destinies and give timely pre-warning about an upcoming impact of various Planets. The past life Karma reveals the problems, challenges and obstacles one would face in their present life. And through the platform of Anytime Astro, renowned Vedic astrologers will help you to discover your *Rinanu Bandhan* (past life Sanchit Karma) to instill happiness, joy and positivity in your present as well as future and to resolve every mystery and concern of your life that troubles you.",
